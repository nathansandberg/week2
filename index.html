                        <p>Join us in helping those in need by 
                        purchasing a one of a kind cookie-cutter 
                        for only $30. 
                        The cutters are hand-made by a local artisan
                        and 60% of proceeds go to support <em>Salmon Whisperer</em>, 
                        a Portland based, non-profit organization helping those who 
                        cannot help themselves by teaching them to fish.

                        <p> Meet Pat. Pat started Cookie Stand in 1998
                            after waking from a vivid dream in which, 
                            he claims, a giant salmon jumped out of the 
                            Willamette River into his bike path as he 
                            crossed the Hawthorne Bridge on his way to 
                            work one morning. 

                            His friends called him crazy and abandoned
                            him but Pat will celebrate the 20th anniversary
                            of Cookie Stand this April.

                            2018 is the year of the Salmon as Pat expands
                            his cookie empire into three other states with 
                            locations opening soon in WA, ID, CA.

                        <p>Lets face it. When you first hear of a cookie that contains
                            Salmon your first reaction probably isn't going to involve
                            eating a pile of 'em. However, after 20 years in business
                            with over 86,000 cookies sold you can't call our army of 
                            loyal cookie afficionados crazy anymore!
